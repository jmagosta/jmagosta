### About

John Mark Agosta works in machine learning in the Bay Area, and more specifically, on problem formulations using Bayesian methods that mix data and judgment. (Think of data as a memory and judgment as desire, and youâ€™ll understand how the title relates to my interests.).

You can find a list of my publications [here](http://www.agosta.org/jma_publications.html).
