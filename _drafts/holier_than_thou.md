## Holier than you

March 5, 2011
Quakers were discriminated against by New England Puritans in Colonial times for differences that were hardly distinguishable, even at that time. The Quakers were more puritanical in their ascetic religious zeal than even the Puritans. Perhaps we’ve lost the fine taste for heresy that let the Puritan authorities weed out these perceived deviants. Or perhaps they relied on the obvious social peculiarities we’d recognize today: Quakers were identified by their habit of using thee and thou, an anachronism even at that time, and by their refusal to doff their hats as a sign of respect. And for this they were put to death. It seems that the most trenchant social divisions are between groups indistinguishable by outsiders: Northern and Free Irish, Sunni and Shiite Arabs, Orthodox and Catholics in Eastern Europe.

They found the ability to thrive in face of social ostracism:

	From the inception of Quakerism, when its followers were persecuted by the established 
	church and state, in both England and America, Quakers were, by avid choice and 
	practice, outsiders to normal society, barred from government service, from civil and 
	legal professions, and from universities; and their pacifism prohibited military 
	service. Like Jews of Eastern Europe, persecuted through millennia, what was left to 
	them was trade, financial services, and medicine, and at these callings Quakers 
	excelled. Through native ability, honesty, and energy, they became disproportionately 
	more prosperous and influential than those who had been accorded every advantage 
	offered by the society around them.(p.142 P. Nichols, Final Voyage, 2009)

Similar was the social status of Quakers and their role in England’s industrial revolution.

Their exceptionality in America was clearest in their primacy in whaling, and in monopolizing the whale oil trade, out of Bedford and Nantucket, Massachusetts. Quakers were the first oil barrons, which was brought to an end by the extermination of the ocean’s whale population in temperate waters. The populations dwindled to the point that whaling ships went in pursuit of their harvest through the Bering Straits, to Point Barrow, where in 1871 a large part of the entire fleet was lost in abnormal weather, leading in turn to the financial ruin of the industry.

Nichols, in the book quoted above, tells this story vividly — which brings me to a thought about this blog. Its my desire to refrain from rehashing content from other sites on the Web–web search makes that accessible enough, but instead to chronicle my readings, and incidentally, if you’ve noticed, work the words “desire” or “memory” from the blog’s title into each posting.
