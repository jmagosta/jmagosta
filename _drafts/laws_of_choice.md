## Newton’s Laws of Choice

February 11, 2011
Decision Theory is an amazingly durable framework for anything to do with choice, desire, reasoning, and acting on information, despite the controversy and polemics it evokes in some fields. I liken it to Newton’s laws in Physics. Once internalized, all subsequent ideas on the topic can only be comprehended as an extension, refinement or exception to the encompassing framework it presents. And a discussion with someone not versed in the Theory wanders, unanchored, in attempts to come to common terms.

Rationality is a broader concept, encompassing theories by which an agent acts to achieve its goals. Rationality is instrumental, since it doesn’t specify goals, requiring only that actions are consistent with them. Economic rationality considers more specifically goals expressed as values that can be quantified, blending into decision theory. To see what fun some have had with this, here’s a footnote about rationality from a book “Fooled by Randomness” by N. Taleb, a popular curmugeon:

	“… it has been developed the most by economists as a normative theory of choice. .. 
	The characteristics and behavior of such homo economicus … include nonsatiation (more 
	is always preferred to less) and transitivity (global consistency in choice). For 
	instance, Arrow (1987) writes, “It is noteworthy that the everyday usage of the term 
	‘rationality’ does not correspond to the economist’s definition… The common 
	understanding is instead the complete exploitation of information, sound reasoning and 
	so forth.”

.. which really gets closer to the original concept of decision theory.

The canonical reference on the Theory is von Neumann & Morgenstern’s Theory of Games (1947), which ironically is about multiple person decisions, however earlier precedents, by de Finetti, (1931), Ramsey (1931) and other probabilists, with attributions going back to Bayes underlie the probabilistic aspects. There are good modern presentations by R.C. Jeffrey (1965), (with the welcome substitution of the less confusing “desirability” for “utility”), Raiffa “Decision Analysis” (1968), D.V. Lindley “Making Decisions” (1971) and French “Decision Theory” (1980). Related disciplines of Economics, Bayesian Statistics, and Artificial Intelligence all have blossomed more recently with numerous authors worth reading that merit separate posts.
