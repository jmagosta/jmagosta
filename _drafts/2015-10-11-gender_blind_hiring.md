# Gender imbalance in Hiring in Silicon Valley

This issue has risen to national attention, notably in the case of [Ellen Pao](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/technology/ellen-pao-kleiner-perkins-case-decision.html?_r=0), and, in entirely
different context, appearing today in NYT Sunday Review opinion piece, by [Eileen Pollack.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/opinion/sunday/what-really-keeps-women-out-of-tech.html?ref=opinion)
I can empathize with Ms. Pollack, sharing the same degree and Alma Mater, but offer a view into different circumstances.
Having gone through a hiring process this year as a data scientist, then soon after succeeding in finding myself a new manager attempting to hire, I offer
this anecdotal view from the front lines of hiring in the field.

To make this tangible consider a typical sample of names from resumes that our corporate recruiters send us, scrambled for the sake of the candidates' privacy.

I do respect the work of our recruiters to find qualified candidates from all available sources in a fast-paced, viciously competitive job market.  The list is a typical mix of Asian, Eastern European, Middle Eastern and occasional South American talent, typically who came to the U.S. for graduate school, then stayed for employment in high tech.  Less than one in ten will have U.S. undergraduate degrees, and of those a small fraction will be U.S. born.  I find myself in most all cases not even knowing the the gender of the candidate when I select which resumes for interview.

Eileen's concern about a juvenile male oriented culture is familiar to us who share her background, but its just one of many expressions, and not uniform within tech. The culture is by nature of its origins a seat of multi-culturalism, and also 


What keeps women out of the larger, less visible expanse of high tech is determined by the gender imbalance in education in parts of the world for which we rely on the overwhelming large fraction
of our talent,  not what goes on in the traditional sciences in U.S. universities, nor in the hiring processes of our companies.  THe future has a bright side: the trends toward an expansion into "softer" tech - in complemenary fields of design, user experience, and linguistics promise to bring with
it a more gender balanced culture. It may not be the solution the critics seek,  but at the bottom, increasing the number of women in tech would best be achieved by improving their chances in their
countries of origin.
