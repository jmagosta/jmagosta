title: Whence Data Science? A Look into its Origins
layout: post
---

Where did Data Science come from, and what defines this new field?
Here is a bibliography of some seminal, critical opinions, from
Statistics, from Computer Science and early Machine Learning to
offer some deep background into a controversial question.

In my view several fields have been running in parallel as researchers
devise better means to glean understanding from data, and what we are
seeing is a strong convergence between data analysis and AI fields in
Computer Science as it pervades areas more typical of
Statistics. Statistics only lately has evolved (or some would say was
dragged under protest) into more general applied computational areas.

It is too soon to give a succint definition of Data Science, and
that's why I offer a historical view into where it is today, as a way
to get a clue into the next question--- _Whither Data Science?_ My
opinion is that the answer will become clearer by exploring the fundamental
philosophical questions of inference and causality that underlie
reasoning from data.

To form one's own opinion here's a selected set of sources marking
some key milestones that every serious researcher in the field should
be aware of.  There are links to pdf files for each item herein.

### Machine Learning before Data Science (and even before Machine Learning was connected to Statistics)

> Nils J. Nilsson
> __Learning Machines__ (1965, McGraw-Hill) [Reprinted, with Introduction](/lit/LearningMachine_Introduction1990.pdf)
> by Terrence Sejnowski and Halbert White, (1990, Morgan Kaufmann).

The introduction to the new edition reviews the origins in Computer
Science of what has become known as neural networks, which was a seminal numerical
approach in to learning Aritificial Intelligence.

### Empirical Predictions

> Leo Breiman
> __Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures__ [(with comments and a rejoinder by the author)](/lit/Breiman_TwoCultures2001.pdf),
> Statistical Science
> Volume 16, Issue 3 (2001), 199-231.

This article makes the point for the primacy of predictive, empirical
techniques as an emerging defining feature of this new science.  His
argument gains credibility from 
Breiman's work in _CART_
(Classification And Regression Trees) that was recognized by both
communities as a novel contribution, marking an early point of
convergence between research in Statistics and Machine Learning. 


### Massive statistical language succcess

> Halevy, A., Norvig, P. and Pereira, F (Google)
> __The unreasonable effectiveness of data__, (2009), Intelligent Systems, IEEE
> Volume 24(2), pp. 8-12.  
> [Here](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/Staff/ukoethe/lehre/AlgorithmsForBigData/halevy_09_unreasonable-effectiveness-of-data.pdf) or
> [here.](/lit/halevy_09_unreasonable-effectiveness-of-data.pdf)

In this early reference to _Big Data_, the authors explain that the
title refers back to a historic paper "The unreasonable effectiveness
of mathematics". The paper argues that access to hitherto impossibly
large collections of simultaneous translations make possible by
Google's web scraping moreso than advances in theory 
 solved the automatic translations problem that
 had been the goal of linguists for decades. A similar argument can be
 made for the recent advances by Deep Neural Networks in computer
 vision and speech processing. 

### History of Learning from Data

> David Donoho
> __50 years of Data Science__, ([draft](/lit/50YearsDataScience.pdf), version 1.00, September 2015).

Building on Breiman's ideas, the author attributes the term _Data Science_ to William Cleveland, in
2001, for a trend in the field going back aways that gives equal importance to the
exploration and extraction of information from data, beyond the
conventional methods in the field.
 
Along the same lines Joe Blitzstein, of Harvard published his own list of other well-known Statistian's
opinions, in a
[post on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-do-statisticians-think-of-data-science).

1.  Going back to the origins of Statistics, Bin Yu shows how many of
its predecessors embodied larger domains of applied and computational
skills that define Data Science today:

(Bin Yu)

2. Larry's Statistics blog laments that not enough attention is paid
to Statistics by data scientists, while conceding that statisticians have limited
computational skills in the face of current problems.

    (Larry Wasserman)

3. This blog starts with a favorable review of the O'Reilly book _Doing Data
 Science_ by Rachel Schutt and Cathy O’Neil to make the point that
 Statistics is the smaller part of doing data science.

4. Terry's video lecture, to quote from the Vimeo description:, _... reports on some reflections on Big Data issues, offer some suggestions for statisticians, and summarize some theory which, in his opinion, has relevance to the analysis of data, whoever does it._  [Data Science, Big Data and Statistics – can we all live together?](http://vimeo.com/91502942) (Terry Speed)

5.  From a larger discussion on reddit, arguing that the distinction between Machine Learning and Statistics, and similarly between theory and application is blurred: [AMA: Michael I Jordan • /r/MachineLearning](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2fxi6v/ama_michael_i_jordan/ckelmtt)
