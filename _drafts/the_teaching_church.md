## The teaching Church?
February 13, 2012
(This is a blog comment posted on several politically active Catholic websites.  The (recent response of the Catholic Bishops)[http://usccb.org/news/2012/12-026.cfm] had me feeling its about time to enter the public debate and try to tone down the vitriol that’s ensued.  These comments were not well received, to say it politely.)

Essentially many people — right or wrong — don’t believe that contraception is immoral, despite the Catholic Church’s teaching. And many of these folks work for Catholic organizations. It’s not “an attack on religious freedom” to accomodate their desires. It’s an act of toleration, even if one thinks contraception wrong. Let the Church teach abstinence. (I believe it already teaches tolerance but this voice seems to be drowned out. ) Letting religious institutions restrict the insurance insurance plans offered is not going to teach anyone anything except how politicized (in a bad way) some religious groups have become.

Religious institutions do not pay, insurance companies do:

	Insurers will create policy not including contraceptive coverage in the contract for 	
	religious organizations that object. Second, the same insurance company must 
	simultaneously offer contraceptive coverage to all employees, and cannot charge an 	
	additional premium.

So religious institutions must pay insurance companies and insurance companies must offer restricted plans. I don’t see the problem. One doesn’t get to tell one’s vendors how to run their business.  Render to Caesar what is Caesar’s.

And as for the tone taken by some prominent members of the Catholic community, one can hope that in the future cooler heads will prevail.
