## Where the title comes from.

> April is the cruelest month, breeding
> Lilacs out of the dead land, **mixing
> Memory and desire,** stirring
> Dull roots with spring rain.

Why bring up memory and desire? Place it in contrast to intelligence, the current 
darling of elite culture. How often would you hear “I want my kids to be intelligent”, compared to “I want my kids to have good Memory?”, or Desire? But Memory and Desire I maintain are more fundamental to our human nature. Heck, I can build a machine that’s intelligent.
