# Whence Data Science? A Look into its Origins

Where did Data Science come from, and what defines this new field?
Here is a 
bibliography of some seminal, critical opinions,  from Statistics,  from Computer Science
and early Machine Learning
that avoid the hype.  I think every serious researcher
in the field should be aware of these sources.

### Machine Learning before Data Science (and even before Statistics)

> Nils J. Nilsson
> _Learning Machines_ (1965, McGraw-Hill) Reprinted, with Introduction
> by Terrence Sejnowski and Halbert White, (1990, Morgan Kaufmann).

The introduction to the new edition reviews the origins in Computer
Science of what has become known as neural networks, as a numerical
approach in Aritificial Intelligence to learning.

### Empirical Predictions

> Leo Breiman
> _Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures (with comments and a rejoinder by the author)_
> Statistical Science
> Volume 16, Issue 3 (2001), 199-231.

This article makes the point for the primacy of predictive, empirical
techniques as an emerging trend of a new science. 


### Massive statistical language succcess

> Halevy, A., Norvig, P. and Pereira, F (Google)
> _The unreasonable effectiveness of data_, (2009), Intelligent Systems, IEEE
> Volume 24(2), pp. 8-12.
> [here](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/Staff/ukoethe/lehre/AlgorithmsForBigData/halevy_09_unreasonable-effectiveness-of-data.pdf) or
> [here](/lit/halevy_09_unreasonable-effectiveness-of-data.pdf)

In this early reference to _Big Data_, the authors explain that the title refers back to a historic paper "The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics".

### History of Learning from Data

> David Donoho
> _50 years of Data Science_, (draft, version 1.00, September 2015).

Building on Breiman's ideas, the author attributes the term _Data Science_ to William Cleveland, in
2001, for a trend in the field going back aways that gives equal importance to the
exploration and extraction of information from data, beyond the
conventional methods in the field.
 

My own opinions??
