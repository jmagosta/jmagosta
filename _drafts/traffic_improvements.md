# What to do about the traffic

An overlooked concern.  

Traffic is a growing problem as an undesirable side effect of burgeoning growth in the area,  and the major immediate concern to quality of life here in in the Bay Area. Here are some proposals for how to ameliorate the problems, ordered from simple and easy to hard and costly.  Some can be implemented now, some require money and collaboration across groups and entities.  Many of them borrow from examples other places here and abroad that have shown them to work. Many imply a radical increase in transportation resources and funding directed at improving overall quality of life. 

- **At congested intersections, at critical times of day, rely on human traffic direction.**   No traffic plans or automatic controls work better than trained people at directing traffic.  No machines yet compete with human intelligence at getting traffic to flow.

  - Major sports events at Stanford already implement this. 
  - In Japan its a daily occurrence at busy city intersections, or at parking garage entrances to see one or more persons employed directing traffic.
  - The school crossing guard program could be extended with suitable training to include traffic direction.   Current crossing guards are oblivious to traffic, and occasionally create more problems than they solve. 
  - Proposal: Create a public service job as a traffic direction employee to expand on and replace current school crossing guards.

- **Integrate overlapping public transportation services** Three bus services run through Palo Alto, each oblivious to the others. Change VTA to incremental pricing; short trips in the city cost the same as inter-city trips. Make VTA trips within a town free, as other in-town options are.

	- Create the political will to unify the numerous Bay Area transit services under common administration. 

- **Create connections between dedicated bicycle routes.** City bike routes, many that are well established,  are in separate segments that come to an end before a disconnected segment starts again.

- **Expand traffic calming roadway design.** Modifications that require more of a drivers attention and force traffic to move at an even steady pace.  Rely less on rules of the road controls, such as stop signs, by slower speed less intersecting routes. 

	- Japanese example: Narrow one lane streets, no side of the street parking. 

- **Aim for a 5-min between arrivals goal for public transit** Make smaller, frequent services to make them competitive in travel time to single-driver cars.  Come up with a universal app that tracks the arrival of the next bus or van, computes optimal routes and implements a universal fare system.

	- Caltrains frequency is limited by crossing-gate intervals: Increasing the train frequency would bring cross-town traffic to a halt. The ultimate solution must be below grade train right-of-way, with concurrent savings in train-related deaths. 

- **Completely separate car, pedestrian and bike traffic.** As people abandon automotive transportation, the conflict between different modes increases and the accident rate between modes will increase.  European and Japanese safety measures place greater emphasis on pedestrian and bike safety than U.S. standards do. We should anticipate this will be a growing concern in the face of the decrease in automobile accidents as self-driving cars reduce sources car-to-car.

	- Major conflict -- street-side parking and bike lanes. Divide up "over wide" streets into separate car and bike segments (College Ave.) 

- **Remove intersecting routes between different modes.** Similar to the previous point, intersection designs should eliminate crossings between pedestrians, bicycles, trains and cars. 

	- In Amsterdam - separate bike and pedestrian ways.  Bikes have right of way over pedestrians on bike paths. See the extreme example of a major highway intersection construction that uses elevated bikeways to entirely remove shared bike-car right-of-way.

	- Remove pedestrian crosswalks on major routes - El Camino, Foothill expressway, Central expressway - in favor of over and underpasses.  Walking cities in other parts of the world include malls and traffic-limited streets that are primary pedestrian 

- **Use targeted public right of eminent domain to cherry pick route improvements**  Critical improvements in "private road" designs.  (See below, recovering previous rail right-of-way.)

- **Advocate and participate in experiments in vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure networking**

- **Solicit proposals for novel technologies.**   Elevated passenger transit that does not require new rights of way.  Individual dispatchable vehicles. 

- **Designate current high-density automated lanes along major connector routes.**  Current necessary high-density development along, e.g. El Camino place unrealistic demands on road traffic.  Dedicated rights-of-way for lightrail or railway-road hybrids that increase capacity and decrease travel time.  Shared high-density routes in anticipation of mixtures of private and public self-driving vehicles to vastly increase capacity of current roadways. 

These ideas imply radical policy, technology and engineering changes, in the spirit of the innovations characteristic of Bay Area culture.
