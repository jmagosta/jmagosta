## How to sign up for TSA-Pre Privileges

It's not well known that you can apply for a "Known Traveler Number" (KTN) from
Homeland Security's TSA [Universal Enrollment Services](https://universalenroll.dhs.gov)
pre-approval program.
Enter the KTN when you make your reservation and your boarding pass will grant you
unfettered access to the *TSA-Pre* line at airport security, so no
waiting on the long lines with everyone else.

This is not the well publicized commercial *ClearMe* service whose kiosks
one sees outside security stations.  That runs $179/year. The TSA's program
has a one-time $85 fee. *ClearMe* has some additional advantages, such as
including family members up to 18 year's old. You decide if it is worth it.

To sign up fill out the *Pre-Enroll* instructions on the
[Universal Enroll](https://universalenroll.dhs.gov) website.
After you do, you'll get a choice
of appointment times for an interview at a TSA-sponsored office typically near a
major airport.
In inscrutable
government fashion the site enjoins you, "*At this time, please only pre-enroll if
you will visit an enrollment center within the next 120 days.*" I'm not sure
what this means. Should one fear
that applications may no longer be taken for grant of such
magnanimous privileges past 120 days from now?  Or that there's a growing trend to
procrastinate among applicants to put off their appointments that the government
wants to put to an end? I just went and
signed up for the first appointment available. 
In San Jose, CA the office is run by *IdentoGO*. It occupies a non-descript suite
in the back of a sign-less office building.  Thank goodness for Google Maps.

When you enter, an appropriately surly employee will have you sign-in with the time
that you've arrived, as given by a digital clock next to their clipboard. The employee
will then diligently highlight the time you've entered in yellow highlighter. Shortly
thereafter you will be led into a closed room where your passport will be scanned and
fingerprints taken and you will be prompted on a computer screen with exactly the same
questions that you filled out on the website.

However before the interview begins the interviewer, notable for her
excessive use of eye-makeup, will call the desk where you signed in
and verify your arrival time as was highlighted in yellow, to check
that your arrival time is not more than seven minutes past your
designated appointment time.  **This is clearly the most stringent
requirement you need to meet to complete your application.**
Conceivably if you don't meet this test your patience may be tested by being asked to wait
until a free appointment slot opens up, on a time-available basis, on the outside
chance that one would be available before close-of-business that day. 

Promptness on your part is valued, but not on the government's part.  Once your
interview is complete, you'll be given a receipt and informed that a decision will
be made on your application within 45 days, during which one imagines computers will be
running day-and-night to verify your street address, and so on.  Then with luck upon approval
one additional travel nuisance will be lightened if not eliminated.
