## When oil mixed with oceans

June 4, 2011
The economics of whaling are an object lesson for the growth and decay of an industry that was the original source of New England fortunes. In the 19th century whaling hunting grounds became more remote, as fertile grounds closer to New England’s seas were depleted, so that by mid century whaling had moved largely to the Pacific, and then to its far artic reaches.

“Rock oil” was a curiosity at the time. The practical history of oil production began in 1859, when George Bissell, a graduate of Dartmouth College, became aware of “distilled rock oil” – then used as a quack medical cure. On advice from Benjamin Silliman, professor of Chemistry at Yale he realized it’s value as illuminating oil – that is, as a substitute for whale oil. But production only became practical by innovation of recovering oil from underground. He was the first to attempt drilling for oil in Pennsylvania, noting that oil would occasionally appear there in well water, Speculating on its commercial potential, he formed Seneca Oil. By 1862 oil production topped 3 million barrels. The harvest of one whaling vessel’s three year journey was about the same as the daily production of an oil well.

Ironically it was an explorer for the Pacific Stem Whaling Company, Charlie Brower, who traveling to Point Barrow discovered “rock oil” from what today is Alaska’s largest oil field. At the time, in 1886, it was too early to develop the area for drilling, and too late to extend whaling further north.

The petroleum industry was taking off, but still whaling remained a major industry, of such perceived importance that whaling fleets were economic targets in the Civil War, and the fleets suffered serious losses in attacks by the South. But the deciding blow to the whaling industry occurred in the fall of 1871, when the entire fleet in the Artic could not make it back through the Bering strait as ice encroached upon the vessels. 1200 men, women and children abandoned their sailing vessels and entire investment in hulls and their cargo. Every soul was saved, a credit to the skill and seamenship of the crews, but every wooden ship – all 32 – were lost; a disaster from which the industry never recovered. The 1200 made it back to San Francisco by steamship, then across country by the just completed transcontinental railroad, a journey symbolically echoing the loss of wind, wood and the wild hunt, to be replaced by iron, oil and settled industry.
