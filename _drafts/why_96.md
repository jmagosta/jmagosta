## Why 96?

Archimedes Approximation

[Polygon with 96 sides](./approx_pi.pdf)

I remember in high school we were taught that 22/7 approximates Ï€. The origin of this approximation is the Sicilian polymath, Archimedes, who inscribed and ex-scribed the circle in ever-more multi-sided regular polygons that bracketed its area. Hence the picture, which implies a general method for approximation. But why did he stop at 96 sides? I suppose because other polygons imply irrational bounds? The answer is left as an exercise to the reader.
