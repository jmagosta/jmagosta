title: Whence Data Science? A Look into its Origins
layout: post
---

Where did Data Science come from, and what defines this new field?
Here is a 
bibliography of some seminal, critical opinions,  from Statistics,  from Computer Science
and early Machine Learning
that avoid the hype.  I think every serious researcher
in the field should be aware of these sources.  There are links to pdf
files for each item herein. 

### Machine Learning before Data Science (and even before Statistics)

> Nils J. Nilsson
> __Learning Machines__ (1965, McGraw-Hill) [Reprinted, with Introduction](/lit/LearningMachine_Introduction1990.pdf)
> by Terrence Sejnowski and Halbert White, (1990, Morgan Kaufmann).

The introduction to the new edition reviews the origins in Computer
Science of what has become known as neural networks, as a numerical
approach in Aritificial Intelligence to learning.

### Empirical Predictions

> Leo Breiman
> __Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures__ [(with comments and a rejoinder by the author)](/lit/Breiman_TwoCultures2001.pdf),
> Statistical Science
> Volume 16, Issue 3 (2001), 199-231.

This article makes the point for the primacy of predictive, empirical
techniques as an emerging trend of a new science. 


### Massive statistical language succcess

> Halevy, A., Norvig, P. and Pereira, F (Google)
> __The unreasonable effectiveness of data__, (2009), Intelligent Systems, IEEE
> Volume 24(2), pp. 8-12.  
> [Here](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/Staff/ukoethe/lehre/AlgorithmsForBigData/halevy_09_unreasonable-effectiveness-of-data.pdf) or
> [here.](/lit/halevy_09_unreasonable-effectiveness-of-data.pdf)

In this early reference to _Big Data_, the authors explain that the title refers back to a historic paper "The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics". 

### History of Learning from Data

> David Donoho
> __50 years of Data Science__, ([draft](/lit/50YearsDataScience.pdf), version 1.00, September 2015).

Building on Breiman's ideas, the author attributes the term _Data Science_ to William Cleveland, in
2001, for a trend in the field going back aways that gives equal importance to the
exploration and extraction of information from data, beyond the
conventional methods in the field.
 

As for my own opinions??
