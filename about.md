### The Origin of this Title

> April is the cruelest month, breeding  
> Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing  
> __Memory and desire__, stirring  
> Dull roots with spring rain.  
>	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; T.S. Elliot, The Wasteland  

Why call out  _Memory and Desire_ to label this blog's posts? 
Put these qualities alongside  
_intelligence_, the current darling of elite culture, and target of
wide-ranging
research in Artificial Intelligence. How
often would you hear "I want my kids to be intelligent", compared to
"I want my kids to develop good Memories?", or "to know the sources of
their desire?"  But Memory and
Desire I maintain are more fundamental, and key to the mystery of our human nature.  Heck, we
already have a good idea how one can build a machine that's intelligent.
