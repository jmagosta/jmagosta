## Computer Confederates

January 24, 2011
I thought Cliff Nass’ latest book was just another good HCI read.  It is much more: (Thank you Trevor!) —an ingenious application of people’s natural tendency to attribute human attributes to things (read computers) in the world, like feelings, intentions, desires, & judgments.  In short, you can learn a lot of individual psychology by the way people personally relate to computers. The premise is that applied psychological research requires immersing the subject in a consistent objective situation to study how people react.  People react to computer created dialogs in ways that reveal their behavior to other humans, thus an experiment built around a computer interaction can explore psychological behavior between humans.  In Cliff’s words

	I realized that just as studying interactions between people is the best way to 
	discover how people interact with computers, people’s interactions with computers 
	could be the best way to study how people interact with each other.

Brilliant Cliff!

A typical experiment to elicit behavior from a human subjects, requires a shill as a stand-in for the other side of the relationship; a *confederate* in league with the researcher, unbeknownst to the subject, whose behavior varies in some dimension, and whose effect on the subject can be measured after the experimental session. The book starts with the example of flattery —does it have a real effect or do people discount it, perceiving it’s insincere?   Well, lest I give too much away, read the book:
