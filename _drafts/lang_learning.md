# Learning languages by using them

The natural way to pick up phrases in a new language is to try saying something and see what response one gets.  Think of how children learn.  It's a kind of active learning---say something, often in imitation of something you've heard, then see what your interlocutor says in response, if it was anything like what you expect. An embarassing moment can be a powerful teacher.  Soon the sounds you make start taking on meaning. This way of learning is hardly what one would call *studying* a language. 

In this fashion, I make an advocation of asking foreign language speakers to repeat common phrases for me.  We're blessed in high tech in the Bay Area, that English is the *lingua franca* (ironic phrase aka, the ''french'') among a multi-lingual population for which English is a second (third, ...) language. A native English speaker is among a minority---that's grist for another time. 

## Embarrassed

Take this exclamation in Mandarin:

> 不好意思  (Bù hǎoyìsi)

meaning; "I'm embarrased to ask...",  roughly, literally: 
> Not Yes! Meaning/Desire! Think!

In context, this came about when my way was blocked along a bike path through a high-tech campus by a Chinese-speaking crowd having breakfast.  So I asked a young intern what should I say to excuse me which translates idiomatically to "Feel(ing) embarrassed" according to Google Translate.  The 1st 2nd & 4th idiograms are familiar from Japanese Kanji, roughly meaning No, Good (think *ii-desu*, also the second character in Mandarin "Ni hao" - Hello.), and think (as to introduce an opinion). 

# Excuse me
Take Google's translation with a grain of salt. For "excuse me"  Google-Translate specifically returns 

> 对不起！ (Duìbùqǐ!) At not (the) start. 

## Get up
Again the Japanese is helpful, where 起 means "get up". (对, which works like a preposition, has no Kanji equivalent). 

But what about 意, which she wasn't sure has a Kanji equivalent?  It actually does meaning "idea," or "desire" as in 

> 意気地 (ikuji) "self respect" (Japanese)

The second kanji "do" as in Aikido, meaning spirit, the last "chi" (ON reading), meaning 
"ground". Mnemonic - Desire-(my)-Spirit-(to_be_)grounded. 

The charm in this is that the conceptual connections, wrong or right, assist associating meaning with the symbols.
